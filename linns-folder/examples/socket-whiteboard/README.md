# Socket.io whiteboard example

This is an example of a collaborative whiteboard created using socket.io.

## What is the project exploring?

The example was made to explore what the socket.io api library could be used for. In this case a real-time collaborative whiteboard which enables communication through drawing, between browsers that are connected to the same server in the same network.

Since our group project is based on communicating by drawing with your hands on a pot, I did some alterations in the code to fit the concept. Instead of drawing a thin line, I exchanged it to multiple ellipses, making it look more like the drawing was made by using a finger.

## How to use

Make sure you have a text editor, a working terminal and Node.js installed.

1. Open the current environment in the terminal
2. In the terminal, type:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Start the server in the terminal by typing:

```bash
node server.js
```

4. Open up your your browser and type http://localhost:4400
5. Start using the collaborative whiteboard!
