# What is this project?

This project is a prototype of a simple collaborative whiteboard using socket.io.

# What is the project exploring?

This project tests the communication through drawings given the fact that only limited amount of colours are presented and a Clear Screen button is available.

# How to use
1. Open the current environment in the terminal
2. npm ci && npm start
3. Point your browser to `http://localhost:3000`. Optionally, specify
a port by supplying the `PORT` env variable.
