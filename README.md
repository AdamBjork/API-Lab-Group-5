# API-LAB-GROUP-5

In this project we explore the socket.io API library. We have tried out different examples of using the socket API as well as created and applied it in prototypes for our design project.

The socket.io library enables a real-time connection to be made between the browser and a server. Since our project is built on a two-way communication between two artefact we saw a lot of opportunity in exploring possible user experiences with the library.

# Installation
    - In VS Code:
1. Open terminal
2. Open the current environment in the terminal
3. Type npm install

# How to use

1. Start the server by typing "node app.js" in the terminal
2. Open up your your browser and type "http://localhost:3001/"
