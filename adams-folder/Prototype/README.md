## Contributors

This prototype is based on "Whiteboard-example" as well as using some of the server code from Linn Claesson's "socket-whiteboard" and developed by Adam Bj√∂rk.

"Whiteboard-example" was following The Coding Train's series on socket.io and "socket-whiteboard" was following the documentation made by socket.io.
